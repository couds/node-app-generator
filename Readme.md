# Node App Generator

Currently this package only have one type of template (API), this template have what I think is the bare minimum you should have on your api.

## How to use

- Install the package with `npm i -g @couds/node-app-generator`
- Run the generator `node-app-generator`. This will ask you a series of questions, which template you want to use and name of your project.
- Now you can open the project in your favorite code editor.
- Read the readme inside your project for specific instructions of the template.


Code fun =)
